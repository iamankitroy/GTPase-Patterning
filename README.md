# Single-Molecule-Colocalization
Scripts for analysing colocalizations in dual channel single molecule TIRF microscopy data of GTPase and GDI recruitment/extraction events on lipid bilayers. 
- **SpotColocalization_SingleFrame.py**: Used for identifying spot colocalizations from dual channel single molecule TIRF microscopy data. Requires *All_Spots_statistics.csv* files generated with *TrackMate* in *Fiji* for spot and track detection in both channels.
