# Single-Molecule-Colocalization
Scripts for analysing and plotting single molecule colocalization data.
 - **SpotColocalization_SingleFrame.py**: Used for identifying spot colocalizations from dual channel single molecule TIRF microscopy data. Requires *All_Spots_statistics.csv* files generated with *TrackMate* in *Fiji* for spot and track detection in both channels.
